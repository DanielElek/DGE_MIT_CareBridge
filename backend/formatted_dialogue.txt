Doctor: Hey doctor, I came to you because I have a really bad headache for the past two days.
Doctor: And where are you?
Doctor: Feel it?
Doctor: It's somewhere in the back of my head.
Doctor: I tried drinking a lot of water, but even though I drink like four liters per day, it did not help.
Doctor: And have you sleep enough?
Doctor: Yes, well, I guess, like seven hours, seven hours, yeah?
Doctor: Or I sleep around seven hours per day.
Doctor: Okay, and how many hours work?
Doctor: In Monday.
Doctor: Ah, so how many hours I work?
Doctor: I work...
Doctor: Like 12.
Patient: And it's physical or just office jobs?
Doctor: Office jobs.
Doctor: I work at the computer.
Patient: Oh, so you watch the screen for the day?
Doctor: Yes, yes, the entire day actually.
Doctor: And have you glasses or something?
Doctor: Yeah, I just know more glasses for vision correction.
Patient: Okay, maybe that was the problem.
Patient: So try it with the glass.
Doctor: Ah, okay.
Doctor: Okay.
Doctor: Then I will try looking at the computer without glasses.
Doctor: Thank you, Doc.
Doctor: Bye.
